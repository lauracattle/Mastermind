# Mastermind

This is a windows app that I have created using C# code.
I wanted to extend my c# skills I use for work to a wider context. My daily tasks don't require creating applications so I wanted to develop my skills in this area.
The game randomly simulates 4 colours and the player can guess the colours to deduce the answer.
